In JavaScript, arrays are indeed a type of object. This is why the `typeof` operator returns "object" for arrays created using either `[]` or `new Array()`.

Here's a bit more detail:

1. **Arrays in JavaScript:**

   - Arrays are special objects that are designed to hold a collection of values in an ordered list.
   - JavaScript arrays have properties and methods that allow you to perform traversal and mutation operations.

2. **The `typeof` Operator:**

   - The `typeof` operator is used to determine the type of a variable. However, it only returns "object" for objects, arrays, and `null`.
   - For arrays, it doesn't differentiate between regular objects and arrays, hence it returns "object".

3. **Identifying Arrays:**
   - To accurately check if a variable is an array, you can use the `Array.isArray()` method or `instanceof Array`.

Example:

```javascript
let arr1 = [];
let arr2 = new Array();

console.log(typeof arr1); // "object"
console.log(typeof arr2); // "object"

console.log(Array.isArray(arr1)); // true
console.log(Array.isArray(arr2)); // true

console.log(arr1 instanceof Array); // true
console.log(arr2 instanceof Array); // true
```

In summary, the `typeof` operator returning "object" for arrays is due to arrays being a specialized type of object in JavaScript. For a precise check, use `Array.isArray()` or the `instanceof` operator.
